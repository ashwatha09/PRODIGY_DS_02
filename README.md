Titanic Dataset EDA and Data Cleaning
Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. The dataset is widely used in data science and machine learning to predict passenger survival based on various features such as age, sex, class, and more.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Titanic dataset, which can be obtained from Kaggle here. This dataset provides details about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

Project Objectives
Data Cleaning: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing irrelevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.
Visualization: Create visual representations of the data to better understand the patterns and insights.
Files and Structure
titanic_data.csv: The raw dataset used for analysis.
data_cleaning.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for data cleaning steps.
eda_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis.
visualizations.py: Python script for generating visualizations.
README.md: This file.
Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involves several steps:

Handling Missing Values: Identify and impute or remove missing values.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve analysis.
Data Type Conversion: Ensure all columns have the correct data type for analysis.
Outlier Detection: Identify and address outliers that may skew the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA phase, the following tasks were performed:

Univariate Analysis: Examine the distribution of individual features such as age, fare, and class.
Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between features, such as survival rates across different classes and genders.
Multivariate Analysis: Analyze interactions between multiple features to understand their combined effects on survival.
Visualization
Visualizations are created to provide insights into the dataset:

Histograms: Show the distribution of numeric features.
Bar Charts: Compare categorical feature counts or survival rates.
Heatmaps: Display correlation between features.
Pair Plots: Show pairwise relationships between features.
Installation and Usage
To run the notebooks and scripts, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-eda.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd titanic-eda
Install Dependencies:

It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Notebooks:

Open the Jupyter notebooks (data_cleaning.ipynb and eda_analysis.ipynb) using:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run Visualization Script:

Execute the visualization script with:

bash
Copy code
python visualizations.py
Results
The analysis reveals several key insights:

Survival Rates by Class: Passengers in first class had a higher survival rate compared to those in second and third classes.
Gender and Survival: Women had a significantly higher survival rate compared to men.
Age and Survival: Children had a higher survival rate than adults.
